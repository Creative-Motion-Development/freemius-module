After the module is activated, the Customer data from Freemius is displayed in the sidebar on the Customer editing and ticket pages (if it is found there).
The first opening of the Customer page may take longer than usual, as requests are sent to Freemius.

## Requires
- PHP CURL extension

## INSTALL
- Place module source to Modules folder of your FreeScout installation
- Enable module in modules admin panel
- Configure module on settings page `Manage->Settings->Freemius`
